	TheContext : constant MAP_Error_Properties::Context => 
	"A 49 year old woman underwent an uneventful total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Postoperatively, the patient complained of severe pain and received intravenous morphine sulfate in small increments. She began receiving a continuous infusion of morphine via a patient controlled analgesia (PCA) infusion pump. A few hours after leaving the post anesthesia care unit (PACU) and arriving on the floor, she was found pale with shallow breathing, a faint pulse, and pinpoint pupils. The nursing staff called a \"code,\" and the patient was resuscitated and transferred to the intensive care unit on a respirator. Based on family wishes, life support was withdrawn and the patient died. Review of the case by providers implicated a PCA overdose. While on the PCA infusion pump, the patient is monitored with a respiration rate monitor and a pulse oximeter. If physiological parameters move outside the pre-determined range, the infusion can be stopped and alarms sent to notify the clinical staff and restart the infusion if appropriate. The use of two independent physiological measurements of respiratory function (oxygen saturation and respiratory rate) enables a smart monitor to optimize sensitivity to detecting respiratory compromise while reducing false alarms.";
